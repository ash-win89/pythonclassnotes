#__init__()--a function which always executes when the class being initiated or called,this function used to
#assign values object properties
#constructor -- a constructor always executes when the class called


The __init__() Function
The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to
 do when the object is being created:


class const:

    #magical methods basically dont have names it will automatically executes when we are calling the class
    #if we want to pass arguments owhile creating object of a class the intializer should be there
    #if we pass arguments into a class object intializers will take those arguments
    def __init__(self,name,sal):
        self.name = name
        self.sal = sal
        print('the person name {} and salary is {}'.format(self.name,self.sal))


c = const('rdj',9000)
c
print(c.name)
print(c.sal)


#instance methods --an object can contain methods. object methods are functions that belong to the object
#self -- parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. we can use it to access the variables
#which are belongs to the class
class const:

    #we can initialize the data in any methods the difference between initializers and methods is
    #initializers can take arguments of the class
    def __init__(self,name,sal):
        self.name = name
        self.sal = sal

    #we cannot pass the instance method parameter's argument directly on class through the object
    #we can pass the data
    def names(self,lname):
        self.lname = lname
        print('the user name is',self.name+lname)

    def salary(self):
        print('the salary gettting paid',self.sal)

ob = const('robert',8000)
ob.names('downey')
ob.salary()

#instead of giving self we can use any names

class const:
    def __init__(mine,name,sal):
        mine.name = name
        mine.sal = sal

    def names(other):

2.why we need to pass object as a parameter while defining a class:
The reason you may want to extend object explicitly is it turns the class into a new-style class.
 If you don't explicitly specify it extends object, until Python 3,
  it will default to being an old-style class.

3.what is an monkey patching:
"monkey patching" means adding a new variable or method to a class after it's been deÔ¨Åned

class A(object):
    def __init__(self, num):
        self.num = num
    def __add__(self, other):
        return A(self.num + other.num)
       
4.enhanced way of define initializer:

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, first_name, age, last_name=None):
        if last_name is None:
            self.first_name, self.last_name = first_name.split(" ", 2)
        else:
            self.first_name = first_name
            self.last_name = last_name
            self.full_name = self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
            self.age = age
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.full_name + ".")

h = Person('jhon',' constantine','35')
h.greet()

        
5.defining multiple initializer using class method:

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age
        self.full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

    @classmethod
    def from_full_name(cls, name, age):
        if " " not in name:
            raise ValueError
        first_name, last_name = name.split(" ", 2)
        return cls(first_name, last_name, age)

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is " + self.full_name + ".")

rdj = Person('robert','downy','53')
chris = Person.from_full_name('chris Evans','56')
rdj.greet()
chris.greet()

6.appending with class:

class D:
    x = []
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.x.append(item) # note that this is not an assignment!

d1 = D(1)
d2 = D(2)

d1.x
